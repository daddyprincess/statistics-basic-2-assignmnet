    "2.Negative Skew (Left Skew): In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail on the left side (the lower values) is longer or\n",

    "3.Mode: The mode, which is the most frequently occurring value, may not be affected by outliers unless they occur frequently. \n",

    " range is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can have a substantial impact on the variance and standard deviation because\n",
